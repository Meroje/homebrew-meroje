Homebrew-Meroje
===============
These formulae are customized installs of software in the main repository, or custom made by me.

How do I install these formulae?
--------------------------------
Just `brew tap meroje/meroje` and then `brew install <formula>`.

If the formula conflicts with one from Homebrew/homebrew or another tap, you can `brew install meroje/meroje/<formula>`.

You can also install via URL:

```
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Meroje/homebrew-meroje/master/<formula>.rb
```
